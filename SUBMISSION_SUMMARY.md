- **Error Handling**: Robust validation and graceful failure handling
- **Documentation**: Complete JavaDoc comments and external documentation
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with 10 test scenarios

### 🔍 Testing Results

The module has been thoroughly tested with:
- ✅ Random crime generation
- ✅ Specific crime creation
- ✅ Bulk crime generation
- ✅ Crime filtering and retrieval
- ✅ Status updates and resolution
- ✅ Statistics generation
- ✅ Configuration management
- ✅ Database integration

### 🚀 Ready for Integration

The module is designed for seamless integration with:

1. **SimulatorCore** - Can be directly instantiated and used
2. **PoliceManager** - Provides crime data for unit assignment
3. **PathfindingService** - Crime locations ready for routing algorithms
4. **Database Layer** - Fully integrated with CrimeDAO
5. **GUI Components** - Statistics and data ready for visualization

### 💡 Advanced Features

#### Crime Escalation System
```java
// Automatic escalation after 5 minutes
LOW → MEDIUM → HIGH → CRITICAL
```

#### Configurable Parameters
```java
crimeGenerator.setGenerationRate(0.3);     // 30% generation rate
crimeGenerator.setMaxActiveCrimes(75);     // Allow 75 concurrent crimes
```

#### Comprehensive Statistics
```java
Map<String, Object> stats = crimeGenerator.getCrimeStatistics();
// Returns: total crimes, crimes by severity, crimes by type, generation rate, etc.
```

### 📈 Performance Characteristics

- **Memory Efficient**: Active crimes stored in optimized ArrayList
- **Database Optimized**: Batch operations and prepared statements ready
- **Scalable**: Configurable limits prevent resource exhaustion
- **Fast Retrieval**: O(1) lookups for crime ID operations
- **Statistical Analysis**: Real-time statistics without performance impact

### 🔧 Installation and Usage

1. **Compile**: Use provided batch script or IDE
2. **Test**: Run CrimeGeneratorTest to verify functionality
3. **Integrate**: Import into main simulation system
