# Missing Implementation Analysis

## ‚ùå **Floyd Algorithm for Police Station Placement**
**Current Status**: Floyd-Warshall calculates centrality but doesn't actually place stations
**Required Fix**: Use Floyd-Warshall to find optimal station locations based on all-pairs shortest paths

## ‚ùå **Correct Assignment Logic Flow**
**Current Flow**: Find suitable units ‚Üí Use Hungarian for assignment
**Required Flow**: 
1. Use Dijkstra to find nearest police station to crime
2. Check if that station has appropriate units for crime type
3. If not, move to next nearest station
4. Once stations with appropriate units found, use Hungarian for optimal assignment

## ‚ùå **Random Unit Stats**
**Current**: Units only have capability types
**Required**: Each unit needs random stats like:
- Response time efficiency (0.8-1.2x multiplier)
- Equipment quality score (1-10)
- Experience level (Rookie, Veteran, Elite)
- Current workload/fatigue level

## ‚ùå **A* for Police Navigation**
**Current**: Uses Dijkstra for all pathfinding
**Required**: Once units are assigned, they should use A* for fastest route to crime scene

## üîß **Implementation Priority:**
1. Fix station placement using Floyd-Warshall
2. Add random unit stats
3. Implement correct assignment logic (Dijkstra ‚Üí station finding ‚Üí Hungarian)
4. Switch to A* for police navigation
