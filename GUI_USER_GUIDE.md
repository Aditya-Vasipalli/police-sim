# Police Response Time Simulator - GUI Features

## Visual Elements

### Police Stations (Enhanced Blue Pulsing Nodes)
- **6 Floyd-Warshall Optimal Locations**: 45, 145, 135, 125, 113, 99
- **Enhanced Pulsing Blue Effect**: Large stations with double glow rings for maximum visibility
- **Click to View**: Station details, available units, units on mission

### Crime Scenes (Red Pulsing Nodes)  
- **Red Pulsing Effect**: Active crime locations
- **Click to View**: Crime type, severity, responding units

### Police Units (Green Moving Dots)
- **Green Glowing Spheres**: Moving police units
- **Unit ID Display**: Shows "U" + unit number
- **Click to View**: Unit details, mission status, current path

### Regular Nodes (Clean Grey Dots)
- **Grey Nodes**: Regular intersections with clean appearance (no text labels)
- **Click to View**: Location coordinates, road connections

## Interface Improvements

### Clean Visual Design
- **No Text Distortion**: Removed node ID labels for cleaner visual interface
- **Enhanced Station Visibility**: Larger stations with double glow rings
- **Better Contrast**: Improved color schemes for better visibility

### Enhanced Scrolling
- **Larger Map Area**: 3000x2400 pixels for comprehensive city view
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Improved scroll increments (20px unit, 100px block)
- **Full Coverage**: Map displays complete city layout without cutoff

## Interaction Guide

### Mouse Controls
- **Click Stations**: See available vs. on-mission unit counts
- **Click Units**: View unit type, status, current path, destination
- **Click Crimes**: See crime details and responding units
- **Click Nodes**: View intersection information without visual clutter
- **Enhanced Scroll**: Navigate the large 3000x2400 map area smoothly

### Control Panel
- **Start Simulation**: Begin continuous operation
- **Generate Crime**: Create emergency crime event
- **Pause Simulation**: Temporarily halt operations
- **Reset**: Clear all active crimes and return units to stations

## Unit Behavior

### Dispatch Process
1. Crime is generated at random location
2. Nearest available unit is automatically selected
3. Unit marked as "ON MISSION" 
4. Real BFS pathfinding calculates route using road connections
5. Unit moves node-by-node along actual roads

### Mission Cycle
1. **Dispatch**: Unit leaves station → travels to crime scene
2. **Response**: Unit arrives → crime is resolved (red node disappears)
3. **Return**: Unit automatically returns to home station
4. **Available**: Unit marked available for next mission

## Key Features

### Realistic Unit Management
- **31 Total Units**: Distributed across 6 stations (5+ units each)
- **Unit Specialization**: PATROL, EMERGENCY, SWAT, DETECTIVE, etc.
- **Finite Resources**: Units unavailable while on missions
- **Persistent Tracking**: Same units throughout simulation

### Authentic Pathfinding
- **Road-Based Movement**: Units follow actual street connections
- **No Flying**: Units move node-to-node through intersections
- **BFS Algorithm**: Finds shortest path using real graph edges
- **Visual Pathfinding**: See A* paths with directional arrows

### Strategic Station Placement
- **Floyd-Warshall Optimization**: Stations placed for maximum coverage
- **Minimal Overlap**: Each station covers different city areas
- **Distance-Based Dispatch**: Nearest available unit responds first

## Tips for Use

1. **Explore Full Map**: Use enhanced scrolling to see the complete 3000x2400 city
2. **Click Everything**: All visual elements provide detailed information
3. **Watch Enhanced Stations**: Notice the improved visibility with double glow rings
4. **Monitor Resources**: Check station unit counts before/after dispatches
5. **Generate Multiple Crimes**: Test concurrent incident handling

## Technical Details

- **Map Size**: 3000x2400 pixels (enhanced scrollable area)
- **Node Count**: 133 intersections with 482 road connections
- **Update Rate**: 50ms refresh for smooth animation
- **Movement Speed**: Slower (0.008f) for visible node-to-node progression
- **Station Radius**: 15px with enhanced pulsing and outer glow ring
- **Unit Detection**: 12px click radius for moving units
- **Visual Improvements**: No text labels, enhanced contrast, cleaner interface
