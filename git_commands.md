# Git Commands to Push Your CrimeGenerator Module

## The Issue
Your repository has branch protection rules that prevent direct pushes to the main branch. You need to create a pull request instead.

## Solution: Create a Feature Branch and Pull Request

### Step 1: Configure Git (if not already done)
```cmd
git config --global user.name "ParamBande"
git config --global user.email "param.bande24@vit.edu"
```

### Step 2: Create a new feature branch
```cmd
cd "c:\Users\PARAM\Desktop\VIT\SY\DSA\CP\police-sim"
git checkout -b feature/crime-generator-module
```

### Step 3: Add your changes
```cmd
git add .
```

### Step 4: Commit your changes
```cmd
git commit -m "Complete CrimeGenerator module implementation

- Added comprehensive crime generation system
- Implemented 10 crime types with realistic probabilities
- Added 4 severity levels (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- Created automatic crime escalation system
- Added complete Crime model with getters/setters
- Implemented database integration via CrimeDAO
- Added comprehensive test suite and documentation
- Ready for integration with police management system"
```

### Step 5: Push the new branch
```cmd
git push origin feature/crime-generator-module
```

### Step 6: Create Pull Request
After pushing, go to GitHub and:
1. Navigate to: https://github.com/Aditya-Vasipalli/police-sim
2. Click "Compare & pull request" for your new branch
3. Add title: "Complete CrimeGenerator Module Implementation"
4. Add description explaining your changes
5. Request review from your team leader
6. Click "Create pull request"

## Alternative: Quick Commands (Copy-Paste)

Open Command Prompt and run these commands one by one:

```cmd
cd "c:\Users\PARAM\Desktop\VIT\SY\DSA\CP\police-sim"
```

```cmd
git config --global user.name "ParamBande"
```

```cmd
git config --global user.email "param.bande24@vit.edu"
```

```cmd
git checkout -b feature/crime-generator-module
```

```cmd
git add .
```

```cmd
git commit -m "Complete CrimeGenerator module - ready for team leader review"
```

```cmd
git push origin feature/crime-generator-module
```

## What This Does:
1. Creates a new branch called "feature/crime-generator-module"
2. Commits all your changes to this branch
3. Pushes the branch to GitHub
4. Allows you to create a pull request for team leader review

## Next Steps:
1. Your team leader will review the pull request
2. They can approve and merge it into the main branch
3. Your CrimeGenerator module will be officially integrated!
